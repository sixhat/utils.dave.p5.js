# Dave Utils for working with P5.js

This is a collection of utils I use with P5.js to make some of my sketches easier to work with.

It includes tools to work with:

- Grids
- Perceptually uniform colors
- [LSystems](https://sixhat.github.io/utils.dave.p5.js/doc/LSystem.html)
- [Turtle Graphics](https://sixhat.github.io/utils.dave.p5.js/doc/Turtle.html)
- [Ui Menus](https://sixhat.github.io/utils.dave.p5.js/)
- [Oscillators](https://sixhat.github.io/utils.dave.p5.js/doc/Oscillator.html)

## How to use

Download the latest file `utils.dave.p5.js` or `utils.dave.p5.min.js` from [the repository](https://github.com/sixhat/utils.dave.p5.js/tree/master/lib)

In your index.html add library JS to your header, AFTER the p5.js library

```html
<script src='p5.min.js'></script>
<script src='utils.dave.p5.min.js'></script>
```

This makes the classes in utils available to use in your sketch.js

## Documentation

The code has inline code, but you can also check the [documentation online](https://sixhat.github.io/utils.dave.p5.js/doc/).

### Note

This is a work in progress and still far from concluded (or fully documented).

In any case if you find it useful and want to contribute please create a pull-request and I'll gladly add new features/corrections to it.
